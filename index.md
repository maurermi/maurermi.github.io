## Reading List
Currently Reading: 
* *Know This* by John Brockman (and many others)
	* This is a book of essays from scientists, academics, and other smart people describing what they feel to be important problems in science, or more broadly the world. It's a nice casual read, and presents a wide array of ideas in concise packages. I enjoy the perspectives, and it's a nice read to learn what problems are out there that people care about (at least as of 2017). Picked this up from the used book section at [Brookline Booksmith](https://brooklinebooksmith.com/).
* *Dune* by Frank Herbert
	* Never read it!

Recently Read:
* *The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark* by Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan
	* Carl Sagan apparently got a lot of mail about UFOs. He points out how through history, there have been many different phenomena where societies pick out supernatural entities (i.e. demons, aliens) that members of society are convinced that they've observed. These entities tend to be observed more and more frequently until they start to leave the zeitgeist. Often these entities become the target of blame for otherwise hard-to-explain phenomena. The authors clearly have spent a lot of time thinking about this and researching this throughout history. This is a worthwhile read especially for fans of Carl Sagan, though it can drag on at times. 
* *Trusted Data: A New Framework for Identity and Data Sharing* by Alex Pentland, David Shrier, and Thomas Hardjono
	* This book discusses throughout a series of essays, how data is used in modern technology. It's a nice overview of "big data", and also does a nice job describing what privacy concerns with data aggregation are, why they matter, and aims to discuss how we can develop better designs from this perspective. I'll say I don't believe I was the target audience for this book, as it seems better oriented for executives, or policy makers, but I'll say it's generally worth hearing what these authors have to say. Found a copy of this book laying around near my desk in the MIT Media Lab after an event for policy maker types.
