My name is Michael Maurer, I'm from Massachussetts, and this is my webpage. I spend much of my time at the [MIT Digital Currency Initiative](https://dci.mit.edu/) and at [Radius](https://www.radiustech.xyz/) where, by and large I work on low latency and high performance distributed systems. I'm completing a MS degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Computer Systems) from the College of Engineering at Northeastern University, from where I previously received a BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Electrical Engineering). 

I think distributed systems, operating systems, and compilers are really fun to work on. I think communications and cryptography are really interesting. I have a fairly hefty educational background in both probability and statistics, but am eager to branch into new fields (recently group theory). 

I love the Red Sox. 

This website really exists just to collect my thoughts as I have them, but if you'd like to talk more, feel free to reach out at `{my last name | the first two letters of my first name} {at} protonmail {dot} com`.
